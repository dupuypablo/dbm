This code was originally based on the DNS library created 
by Guido van Rossum somewhere near the dawn of time. 

Since then, as well as myself (Anthony), I have had contributions
by:

 Michael Str√∂der
 Bastian Kleineidam
 Timothy J. Miller
 Wolfgang Strobl
 Arnaud Fontaine
 Scott Kitterman
 Stuart Gathman

It's possible there's other people - the old RCS logs for my
code were lost some time ago. The list above is almost certainly
incomplete - let me know if I've forgotten you...
